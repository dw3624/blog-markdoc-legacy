## Get started quickly

[Markdoc core](https://github.com/markdoc/markdoc) is a lightweight package containing everything you need to get started. If you want to get going even faster, check out our [Next.js plugin](https://github.com/markdoc/next.js) and deploy a Markdoc documentation site with zero boilerplate.



```shell

```

```js

```

### Markdoc powers Stripe documentation

Stripe created Markdoc to power its largest and [most detailed content site](https://stripe.com/docs). Since then, we have adopted it across the company, writing hundreds of thousands of lines of Markdoc to create thousands of pages of expressive, custom documentation.
